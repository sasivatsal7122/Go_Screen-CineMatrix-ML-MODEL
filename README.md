 ### That's all for the website promotion, now for the nerd like me who are interested in how this thing works, here is brief summary of the backend:
  ## For starters What is a Recommender system?
A recommender system is a simple algorithm whose aim is to provide the most relevant information to a user by discovering patterns in a dataset. The algorithm rates the items and shows the user the items that they would rate highly. An example of recommendation in action is when you visit Amazon and you notice that some items are being recommended to you or when Netflix recommends certain movies to you. They are alsoused by Music streaming applications such as Spotify and Deezer to
recommend music that you might like. During the last few decades, with the rise of Youtube, Amazon, Netflix and many other such web services, recommender systems have taken more and more place in our lives. From e-commerce (suggest to buyers articles that could interest them) to online advertisement (suggest to users the right contents, matching their preferences), recommender systems are today unavoidable in our daily online journeys.

 ## Classification of Recommending system:

## In CineMatrix i employed content and collabrative systems</br></br>
  - Under **content** based system i used item based filtering, techniques i implemented are: </br></br>
       - **TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency)** is a statistical measure that evaluates how relevant a word is to a document in a collection of documents.
        It works by increasing proportionally to the number of times a word appears in a document, but is offset by the number of documents that contain the word. So, words that         are common in every document. Multiplying and these two(term frequency,inverse document frequency) numbers results in the TF-IDF score of a word in a document. The               higher the score, the more relevant that word is in that particular document.</br>

      - **CountVectorizer** is a great tool provided by the scikit-learn library in Python. It is used to transform a given text into a vector on the basis of the frequency              (count) of each word that occurs in the entire text.CountVectorizer creates a matrix in which each unique word is represented by a column of the matrix, and each text            sample from the document is a row in the matrix. The value of each cell is nothing but the count of the word in that particular text sample.</br> 
      - **Cosine similarity** measures the similarity between two vectors of an inner product space. It is measured by the cosine of the angle between two vectors and determines whether two vectors are pointing in roughly the same direction. It is often used to measure document similarity in text analysis.the smaller the angle and the greater the match between vectors.</br>

      - That's all for the concept part, i first read the datset cleaned it for potential null values
      added couple of coloumns to make the workflow easier, then took the user input, searched for the matrching result in the dataset using dfflib, dfflib searches for the best matching string and returns the value. Then i made two objects of classes TfidfVectorizer() and CountVectorizer(), then i used fit_transform() method for tfidf and count seperately to convert the text data into numerical data and finally used cosine similarity to find the best matching result i.e the words that are makign less angle with the word i given i.e the user movie title. Remaining is to enumerate through the similar movies that cosine similariity has found and print the top results after sorting similarity scores in descending order. The execution time and system resources consumed from this approach are very less compared to other techniques. 
      - i observed tfidf produces great results for some given inputs, and countvectorizer provied great results for other inputs. so i combined the results of both tfidf and            count vectorizer to get atmost precise results, then i passed the obtained combined matrix to the find the cosine similarity.</br>The final output is result of both tfidf and count vectorizer, i selected the top 10 best results and displayed them. Thanks to the pre-processing i've done to the dataset it takes less than second to compute and display recommended movies.</br></br>
      
  - Under **collabrative** based system i used content based filtering, techniques i implemented are: </br></br>
       - In User-based collaborative filtering products are
recommended to a user based on the fact that the products have been
liked by users similar to the user. For example, if Derrick and Dennis
like the same movies and a new movie come out that Derick like,
then we can recommend that movie to Dennis because Derrick and
Dennis seem to like the same movies.
       - I used a movie lend dataset which is really huge and has a size of 250mb for a CSV file.
       I loadaed the dataset stored it in a pandas df, movie lens dataset set contains multiple files each categorized seperately, so i grouped them based on the requirement it was such an headache.After clubbing and removing unneccessary data in rows, cols the final raw input is ready. Then to know what i'm dealing with i ran a few datavisualizing techniques and also built-in pandas methods such as .unique, .describe you get the point ik. I decided on using movie ratings as a factor for deciding the recommended movies.i used these ratings to calculate the
correlation between the movies. Correlation is a statistical measure
that indicates the extent to which two or more variables fluctuate
together. Movies that have a high correlation coefficient are the movies
that are most similar to each other. In our case, we shall use the Pearson
correlation coefficient. This number will lie between -1 and 1. 1 indicates
a positive linear correlation while -1 indicates a negative correlation. 0
indicates no linear correlation. Therefore, movies with a zero correlation
are not similar at all.In order to do this i need create a pivot matrix with row as User_id and col as movie titles and values as ofcourse rating of that movie rated by the respective user.The final step is omputing the correlation between
user given movie ratings and the ratings of the rest of the movies in the
dataset.In order to compute the correlation between two dataframes we use
pandas corwith functionality. Corrwith computes the pairwise correlation
of rows or columns of two data frames objects. Let's use this functionality
to get the correlation between each movie's rating and the ratings of the
Air Force One movie.

 Last step is to order the correlation score in decsending order and return the top 10 movies with highest score, those movies will be the most similar ones. This model works fine but i wanted my recommender to be divesified so i also used other collabrative filtering methods which we will be discussing in the next section.
